I purchased the Investments and Rental Property Turbo Tax Premier and it&#39;s asking me to pay $39.99 when I try to complete my 1 free state tax form. How do I correct this?
 The turbo tax wont let me put in the numbers for the medical deductions.Â  Is there something wrong with the program?  
 Thanks
