Why is line 13a of my 1040EZ form blank, but my state refund amount is listed as accepted?
 The State of Alabama is not showing any information for my state refund. When I log into Turbo tax, it lists my state refund amount and says it's accepted. When I went to verify that I was entering the correct amount and filing status, I noticed that the actual form is missing the refund amount on line 13a of my 1040EZ form. Why is that?
