How do I get rid of the &quot;Schedule C-EZ-T line 4 Date 1&quot; problem which keeps recurring and I thought I&#39;d deleted this but it keeps showing up and won&#39;t let me get past it.
 I just spoke to the revenue dept in Missouri and they said you should have sent me a refund card.  I never got it.
