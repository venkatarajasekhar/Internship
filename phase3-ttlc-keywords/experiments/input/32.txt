How do I file using the free version rather than being prompted for the deluxe version
 I've already completed my return but was only prompted to the Deluxe Version rather than the Free one. My taxes are simple and I didn't need the Deluxe but needed to get my taxes out of the way. I ended up spending about $75 on straight forward taxes. Is there any way to be refunded and apply all my information under the Free version?
