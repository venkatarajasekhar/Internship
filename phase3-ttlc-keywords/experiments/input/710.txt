NY state tax return (part year resident) requires me to do efiling but turbo tax doesn&#39;t give me such option.
 I was a part year resident in NY state and have federal, NY state, and NJ state tax to file. My address as of 12/31/14 is foreign address thus NJ requires me to file by mail while NY State still require me to do efiling. Turbo tax gave me an alert saying I need to file by mail for NJ but was silent about NY. Now I was able to efile federal return and ready to send NJ by mail but NY one was not filed using efiling, instead saying "ready to mail". If I look at print preview, clearing stating I need to do efile for NY state, but turbo tax seem not having such option. Could you advise me what to do? FYI, I've paid amount owe to NY state by credit card through NY state official website.
