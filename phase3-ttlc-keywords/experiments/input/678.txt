I need help to correct this problem. Wrong E file or AGI form Turbo expert.
 my state is asking for 2012 return. it seems that they both were rejected..ie federal and state. I go to the return and can open the file, but can not seem to find where to correct it or re-file. I not sure what is even wrong with it.
