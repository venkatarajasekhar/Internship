is there a way to open the state in premier when it keeps telling me everything is up to date, and then wont open it?
 I have completed my fed portion and am trying to do the 2 state portions, but it wont let me open either state Ca. or mo. it says after updating everything is up to date and then when I try to open it goes all through it again. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the product and also tried the TTclean fix.
