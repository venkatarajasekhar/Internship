Does MS allow us to get a credit for the Birmingham municipal income tax paid or only the AL income tax paid if my husband works in Birmingham, AL but we live in MS?
 I am being asked what the expenditure amount is on an Amortizing Startup Costs form.  I am not sure what this means or where to find the information I need.
