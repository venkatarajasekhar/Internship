Payment with amended return.
 I filed my taxes electronically, but then I found an error and filed an amended return.  The TurboTax instruction sheet indicates that my amended balance due will be paid by direct debit.  Is that correct?  I don't see how the IRS would know what amount to debit, because the amended return is mailed.
