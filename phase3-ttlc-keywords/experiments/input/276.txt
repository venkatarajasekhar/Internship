Why is there no option to download .tax for my 2013 tax return? I need to amend my 2013 taxes.
 In 2014 I received a $3,000 award from the non-profit credit union that I volunteer for completing 30 years of service. The IRS is saying I have to pay self employment taxes on it. Is it really considered self employment or how can I respond that it is the regular income that I put on my return?
