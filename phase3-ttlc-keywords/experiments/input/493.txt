Used online version Turbotax and filed an amended return and enclosed with my 1040 (I had received a corrected w-2 from my employer). How do I view amended return on TT?
 When I go online to TT, I only see the original 1040, not the amended one. IRS.gov shows that they received the amended return but have not processed yet. Meanwhile I received a letter today from IRS based on my original 1040 telling me that I needed to pay $4000+ which the amended return resolves. I want to look at and make copies of the amended return, but can't seem to access it at all on my account for 2014. Please HELP!
