On my 1099B from Lending Club, there&#39;s about 80 lines that all add up to a net gain of a few dollars.  Is it ok to just enter the summary line showing the net impact?
 Trying to apply Virginia refund to next year. "Other tax situation" menu says this option will be provided in that part of the TT form, but there is no option or box that allows me to apply refund to next year.
