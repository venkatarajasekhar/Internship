Refund request for e-file that did not go through
 I was charged for e-filing a CA and UT state tax return on Order number: TTDW16947313406, dated April 5th however the CA e-file did not go through due to the lack of a CA tax ID number. After repeated attempts to get the CA tax ID from the payroll department, I gave up and filed the return on paper via the mail. I am asking for a refund of $24.99 for the CA e-file that did not go through.
