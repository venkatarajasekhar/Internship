Where is form 1040EZ in the Personal &amp; Small Business version of TurboTax?
 I'm filing a return for my son using the Personal and Small Business version of TurboTax and form 1040EZ is NOT an option to print. When I print the forms, I get the state return but only the instructions for the federal return. He had no taxable income but he did have investment income which he's required to report. Others who as this question are given a canned response about how to print forms. I know how to print forms and the 1040EZ is not one of those listed. There a lot of other people asking this same question and, three days from filing date, it's past time for Turbo Tax to provide an answer other than "Use the free version."
