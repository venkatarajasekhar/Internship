i am stuck on the health insurance coverge page.
 Hello.  I am having trouble with my form 5329. I made two  contributions to my Roth IRA (2012 and 2013) that I was not allowed to make.  I took two distributions for these amounts (plus the appreciation) in 2014.   On my form 5329, line 18 is showing an incorrect amount and I do not know how to change it.  Where does this number even come from?

Please advise. Thanks, Rob Britton
