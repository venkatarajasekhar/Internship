My 1040X has an error: It appears to be a bug. What do I do?
 I need to file the amendment because the change was on a corrected 1099 I wasn't notified about until last week. The 1040X adjustment yields an $11 refund. I indicated that I want it applied to next year's taxes. Yet the 1040X shows it as being refunded to me (Lines 21 and 22 show $11 each, nothing on Line 23). And the File by Mail intruction sheet says that I have BOTH: $11 refund AND $11 applied to next years taxes, for $22 total! This is obviously a bug, so how do I proceed? I can white out the form to get the job done but my records in Turbotax will be screwed up.
