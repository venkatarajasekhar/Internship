TURBOTAX has withdrawn money twice from my bank account and won&#39;t allow me to finish filing taxes!
 I'm having issues with Turbotax Online software because it won't allow to finish filing my tax return but yet has charged TWICE to my bank accounts!! ThisÂ my second year using Turbotax but I'm started to reconsider using this service for next year tax return because I'm having a very difficult getting my questions answered. I've seen other people's questions that are similar to mine, being resolved but not mine. I'M FEELING EXTREMELY IRRITABLE AND ANGRY!!
