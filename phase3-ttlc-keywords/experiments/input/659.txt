My 2013 1098-t has my bill for my 2014 1098-t but my 2014 1098-t has my scholarships and grants for that bill shown on the 2013 1098-t.  How do I handle this?
 Currently, my 2014 1098-t has empty box 1 &amp; 2 making it look like I should be taxed on my 2014 scholarships &amp; grants when in reality they all went to my tuition
