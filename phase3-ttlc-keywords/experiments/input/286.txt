my returns keep getting rejected over and over again and when I click &quot;fix my return&quot; it doesn&#39;t allow me to fix it. I need a live person.
 TurboTax Claim... NOT refund.
 State is charging me difference, plus fees &amp; interest for a calculation error.Â  I eMailed all requested State paperwork weeks ago, and wonder how long I must patiently wait for Turbo Tax to acknowledge/resolve this. Thanks!!
