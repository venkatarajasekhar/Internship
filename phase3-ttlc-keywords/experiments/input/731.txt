NYS state withholding are not credited by CT state. Using turbotax, I suppose to receive refund but got bill and charges. Can you help?
 Dear Expert: Both my wife and I take 100% incomes from NYS and are 100% CT residence. We have been using Turbotax 10+ years - when enter the info to the federal return, all information is automatically carried to state filings. This year, Turbotax seems use my wife's withholding for NYS tax and we paid additional few hundreds dollars. Turbo uses my NYS withholding $X to credit CT filing and computed $Y refund. Today, I received a bill from CT tax office billed me $Z (exact same as $X-$Y) substantial late fee. It seems CT did not receive the $X from NYS. Can you please kindly explain why and advise how to handle this case. thank you very much!
