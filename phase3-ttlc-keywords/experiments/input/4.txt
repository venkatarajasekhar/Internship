We plan to file as a husband/wife Qualified joint venture for our business.  We received a 1099 with my husband&#39;s social security number. How do we split this?
 A large portion of the business income has been reported on a 1099-K under my husband's social security number.  We are planning to split this income on separate Schedule C's.  Is that going to trigger a problem since my husband isn't reporting the entire amount that has been reported under his social?  What is the appropriate way to handle this?
