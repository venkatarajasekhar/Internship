I got transcript from IRS for 2012 tax year, but what should I check for receiving refund I hadn&#39;t gotten then?
 I (University student as research assistant) didn't receive refund for 2012 tax year, so I requested transcript and got them from IRS. But what should I check in the transcripts (3 forms: 1042-S, W-2, and 1099 G) and what is next step for getting refund?
