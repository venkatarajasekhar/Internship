I needed to verify my identity with IRS so I successfully did so on idverify/irs.org. But I can&#39;t seem to get an update using where&#39;s my money doesn&#39;t work? Please help.
 Hi, I live in NYC and used to work in CT in 2013. I've worked in NYC for all of 2014 but didn't change my work address to NYC until recently. How do I correct for the days worked outside of CT/ in NYC to avoid overpaying?

Thanks!
