the boxes on my form are not matching up with what the boxes u guys are saying maybe this is not a w-2 and is a tuition statement ?
 My 1099 shows "Bond Premium-Covered" in Box 11 as 1367.35.  Later details show "Bond Premium-Non-covered" as 52828.99.  And further details later on show "Annual Bond Amortization" as 55083.68.  I don't know which figures to use as a reduction of my reportable tax exempt income.
