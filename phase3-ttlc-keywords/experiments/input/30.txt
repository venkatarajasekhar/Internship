Other income taxes does not match withholdings from W2s nd 1099R
 Withholdings on W2s = 27,032.09 + 5777.221 for federal and 10139 + 4272 for state. Withholding on 1099R = 5814.35 for federal and 1200.00 for state. An additional 10,000 has been submitted to the IRS as a estimated tax payment. Total withholdings from above are 64,235.  TurboTax has calculated "Other Income Taxes" to be 63,286. Why is there a discrepancy of 949.44 between actual withholdings and "Other Income taxes" as calculated in TurboTax? It appears that I am not getting full credit for monies already withheld or submitted to the IRS.
