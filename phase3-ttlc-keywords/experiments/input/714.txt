It&#39;s unclear for me how to amend my taxes using this software.  I clicked on amend, the file that I already filed with the IRS.  I don&#39;t know how to file the form.
 My federal Status for 2013 says filed and accepted.  I did owe money according to those returns and I still have not received any paperwork from the IRS because it is something like 10000.  Any way to check the status with the IRS without having to call them.. I have not been able to get through.
