need help with completing state return on Premier version of Turbo tax that I have -- state return will not open
 According to the TurboTax filing, we were getting a refund of over $6,000 from the state of Missouri. However, the state says we owe almost $3,000. That's a huge discrepancy. What happened??? is the state correct? Our Federal return went through without a hitch.

Some guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.
