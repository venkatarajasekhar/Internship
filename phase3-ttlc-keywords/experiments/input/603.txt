Deluxe program will not accept my 1099-SA Payer info. Keep getting message to fix errors on page before continuing. Cannot move forward or back.
 Every time I enter my card it says that my card could not be verified and to try again,  I have tried again a couple of times and four charges show up in my bank statement as Pending.    In addition, it won't let me continue my tax return without payment.  Is there a cause for this?  Will those pending transactions go through? How do I complete my tax return?
