do i need to pay self employment tax for a settlement with my employer?
 I'm looking for some way to add another name to the "other party" section of form 8594 since the owners of the property were 3 individuals, acting as partners but with no formal partnership or company.  Seems I would have to put each of the three down, with each one's taxpayer id, etc.  I assume they split everything 3 ways, but I can confirm.  Is there an "addendum" sheet I can access?  Would I enter the acquired asset three times (3 8594s) and list one of them each time, splitting the price of the asset?
