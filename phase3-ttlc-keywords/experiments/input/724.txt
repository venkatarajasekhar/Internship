LLC change in ownership
 This year my LLC partnership changed. Two things- we changed our percentages due to an illness back in August from 50/50 to 80/20. At the end of the year my partner retired leaving me with 100 percent. How should that be documented on the Schedule K-1 partners share? She didn't technical quit until 1/1/2015- so should it be 20% on the ending percentage? Do I need to do anything else to document this years ownership?
