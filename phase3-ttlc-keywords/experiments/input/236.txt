If I claim myself as independent, will my federal loans from my school increase or stay the same, and would my tax return increase, decrease, or stay around the same?
 My mom recently stopped paying child support but I was needing it for the loans I was going to take out so if I file as independent instead of her claiming me as dependent, what would happen to 1. my federal loans and 2. my tax return
