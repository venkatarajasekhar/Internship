I UPGRADED TO TURBOTAX BUSINESS HOW DO I GET MY CONFIRMATION NUMBER
 Estate Received payout for longterm care claim  in 2014 for nursing home care in 2013-2014  -tax id is for the Estate.  Read the Irs rules but too confusing.               He received lump sum payments based on a per diem- regardless of the cost of care. The care was paid for while he was alive. but received to the Estate. Filed his personal taxes 1040 but now need to do estate 1040 return please help. Thanks!
