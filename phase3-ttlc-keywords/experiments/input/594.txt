How do I get a home office deduction for K1 income?  Turbo tax won&#39;t let me claim the deduction because the income is not in the business income section.
 When I look up another tax return that includes CA return, it is there but when I start a new tax return, the CA program is not there.Â  Program says that CA forms are downloaded but I can't get to them for the new return.
