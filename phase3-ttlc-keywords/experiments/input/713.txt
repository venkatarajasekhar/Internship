I am filing my 2013 state returns this year 2015.  How can I make sure that my federal taxes for 2013 were filed as well even though the status says accepted?
 My federal Status for 2013 says filed and accepted.  I did owe money according to those returns and I still have not received any paperwork from the IRS because it is something like 10000.  Any way to check the status with the IRS without having to call them.. I have not been able to get through.
