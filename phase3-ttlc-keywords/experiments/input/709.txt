Do I need to declare my RRSP and TFSA in my US tax return?I am a Canadian Citizen and I work under TN visa in US.
 I am working under TN visa in the US. I have a saving account in Canada which has interest about C $1700. I also have a RRSP and TFSA account in Canada that I have contributed for 2014. I have no T4 from Canada for 2014.Â  Do I need to declare my saving, RRSP and TFSA account for filing US tax? If the answer is yes, where in TurboTax I can file them?
