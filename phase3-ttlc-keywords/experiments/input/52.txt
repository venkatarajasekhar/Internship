Is replacing drainage system to prevent flooding of a garden unit a repair or betterment--can the entire cost be attributed to unit since it is the only unit affected?
 We occupy the top 2 floors of our home and have a garden unit below. We have been dealing with water issues in the rental unit since we moved in a year and a half ago (it actually flooded last year and we had to replace all the floors). We have done a number of things to help reduce the amount of water that gets to the rental unit (e.g. gutter guards, waterproofing foundation, mudjacking sidewalk). We just got water in the unit again so looked deeper and found a drainage system in the backyard that had been improperly installed (not big enough to handle water, not deep enough, not pitched correctly, wrong rocks surrounding, etc.). We now need to fix the drainage system, but the only fix is to replace and properly install the correct unit. I have a few specific questions: 1) Is the cost of the drainage system a repair or a betterment (or something else)? 2) Once the drainage system is installed we will need to finish the yard with sod or pavers or something--what sort of expense would this be? Unlike the drainage system it is not necessary 3) The cost of whatever is done to finish the top of the yard will be assigned 2/3 to our unit and 1/3 to the rental, since it is for the whole property. However, can the cost of the underground work be assigned solely to the rental unit since it is only necessary to keep it from flooding and provides no benefit for our unit? Does it matter if we are using one company for the drainage system and a separate company for landscaping the yard once the drainage system is fixed/installed? Thanks for you help...
