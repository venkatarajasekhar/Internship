what is form 760c. and why do I have to enter the info on this form(liability paid last year???
 We filed for a deceased person.  The exe. court order and the form   created by Turbo Tax sent with the tax in March.  No refund received nor can we find   status online.  Help.It has been three  months.  With whom at the IRS do we communicate and by what method?  We want to close the estate by October.
