Can I get the NY State Tax Department to refund me as my taxes were paid by check and then they also took it out of my account via direct debit?
 I had to amend my taxes due to my employer filing their taxes late and sending out Â MISC 1099 forms after the deadline. TurboTax then said to post the amended NY State Tax amount via check.
 I did this and the check was cleared and banked in May, but now in July they have taken the same amount out of my bank account via direct debit. How do I reverse this and how did they get access to my bank account without my permission?
