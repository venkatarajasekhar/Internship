When applying for tax paid in another state how can I know the amount paid in other state?
 Hello, I moved in a middle of the year from NY to NJ, so I'm applying as partial resident in both states. I'm making income in NY only. The second part of my year is obviously double-taxed: NY taxed it as income from NY source, and NJ taxed it as income of NJ resident. I know this amount and I specified it properly in NY State taxes. When I'm applying for NJ taxes in the form "Other State Information - New York" it asks me two ammounts: "Double-Taxed Income While a Resident of New Jersey" - this I know
 "Tax Paid to New York on Double-Taxed Income" - this only TurboTax knows, but doesn't tell me.
 So, how I get this tax amount paid for part of my NY income? I haven't filed NY State taxes - just prepared them in TurboTax. Where I can find what is prepared there and what is the tax I'm going to pay in NY State from my double-taxed part of income? Thanks
