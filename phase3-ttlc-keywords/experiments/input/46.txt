I choose the amazon gift card option to get my refund partially in amazon credit. My refund was filed on 4/9, it&#39;s 7/14 now and I still have not received my refund.
 What is going on with my refund?
It seems like the amazon option really screwed up my refund.
This is the first time I file with turbo tax and it has not been a good experience.
