issue with health insurance coverage - I&#39;m getting an error message for my entry on Form 1095-Oth and can not figure out what&#39;s wrong.
 In 2014 I received a $3,000 award from the non-profit credit union that I volunteer for completing 30 years of service. The IRS is saying I have to pay self employment taxes on it. Is it really considered self employment or how can I respond that it is the regular income that I put on my return?
