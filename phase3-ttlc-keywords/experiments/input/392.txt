How so I get to the complaint page?
 I have been trying to download my last year's .tax2013 file for two hours. Your online help person was completely unhelpful and didn't understand what my question was but kept repeating some other question.  She was completely useless so I asked to speak to a supervisor and then she just hung up. this is the second year I have had to call your help number and last year the person was useless also. Turbo tax used to be easy to use but now is impossible.  I am going to see if I can return the software and buy a competitor's software. .
