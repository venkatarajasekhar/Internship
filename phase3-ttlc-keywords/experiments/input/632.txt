Saying &quot;No Foreign Income Has Been Entered&quot; when i do?
 I've entered foreign income, but I still get this response when I try to exclude my income: "No Foreign Income Has Been Entered" And on a previous page it registered my foreign amount. How do I get the form to accept my foreign earned income?
