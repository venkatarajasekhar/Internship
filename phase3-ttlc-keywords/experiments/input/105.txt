Purchased business from three individual joint owners (no formal partnership LLC). How do I enter info for all 3 on form 8594 in TT bus which only has space for 1?
 I'm looking for some way to add another name to the "other party" section of form 8594 since the owners of the property were 3 individuals, acting as partners but with no formal partnership or company.  Seems I would have to put each of the three down, with each one's taxpayer id, etc.  I assume they split everything 3 ways, but I can confirm.  Is there an "addendum" sheet I can access?  Would I enter the acquired asset three times (3 8594s) and list one of them each time, splitting the price of the asset?
