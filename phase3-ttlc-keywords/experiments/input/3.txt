Under Deductions &amp; Credits.  I use my vehicle for work, we sold the vehicle and purchased a new one it is asking what the AMT cost were on the old vehicle.
 I checked for the IRS refund status of my step daughter and the response is that I may have entered the wrong SS number. Since she already received her Hawaii State refund, It appears that the IRS return was never received although we sent it @ 04/08/2015.  What is our next step?"
