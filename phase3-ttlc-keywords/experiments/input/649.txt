I am unable to acess my current entries on the 2014 tax return as error report blocks entry.
 I was entering data for a K-1 when error 20120600091 occurred. When I signed out and back on the same error report appeared when I tried to access previous entered data. I am blocked from entering data or changing previous data. I no longer have access to my turbotax entries.
