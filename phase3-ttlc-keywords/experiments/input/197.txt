When entering trust info from a k-1 Turbotax premier asks questions I cannot answer from the k-1.
 When entering the trust info into turbotax I made dollar entries from k1boxes 1, 2a, 2b, 12 A and J, 14 A and B. The program next told me to select the state and the amount of tax exempt interest reported on the k1. My k1 did not show this. Then the program asked me to enter the detail about foreign income reported on the k1. Again my k1 did not indicate this. Next the program asked me to enter the category of income from box 14 of the k1. Again my k1 did not indicate this. Next the program asked me to enter more info about the deductions allocated and apportioned at beneficiary level. There is nothing about this on my k1. There were three more such problems but hopefully you get the idea. I have in the past been an enthusiastic user of turbotax but since we have gotten this inheritance in the form of a trust I have had much frustration with it. Can you offer any suggestions?
