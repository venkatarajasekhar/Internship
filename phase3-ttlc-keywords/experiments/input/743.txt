my return was rejected but my credit card billed for the amount I owed, can they do that without accepting the return?
 The IRS has taken the money from my credit card.  I called the card and they told me the time it was taken.  My e-filed tax form was rejected, I just checked it.  How can this be and what should I do about it.  I am not sending them a check with a paper form when I have already paid with the credit card.
