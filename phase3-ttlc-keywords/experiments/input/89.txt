This is my first time filing as a business owner, what months do I need to include?  From start up Nov 14 to now or just nov and Dec.
 I called a few weeks back on the issue and was told a check would arrive in the mail in 5 days, and I still haven't received any amount of money yet. Also it says I've already accepted my return even though I haven't.
