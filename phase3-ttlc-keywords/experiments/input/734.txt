go to  investments
 I need to redo my 8949 to change one stock to a long term transaction  I'm using TurboTax. I have a long term stock I intered as a short term holding, IBM.  On my 1099B it is listed as long term.  The total long term loss is printed as -8,804.36 or as short term in my IRS forms.  I had entered it as short term on my Income tax form.  How can I get this changed from "I owe you" to "I don't owe you (as much), after all.  Maybe the Fed owes me instead!"  
  Can I then go the my TurboTax Form, change the data and Print out the updated form?    
  I thank you. LEK
