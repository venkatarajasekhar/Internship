I need technical assistance with 2014 Turbotax Home and Business for Mac and saving my return on my computer.
 I'm looking for some way to add another name to the "other party" section of form 8594 since the owners of the property were 3 individuals, acting as partners but with no formal partnership or company.  Seems I would have to put each of the three down, with each one's taxpayer id, etc.  I assume they split everything 3 ways, but I can confirm.  Is there an "addendum" sheet I can access?  Would I enter the acquired asset three times (3 8594s) and list one of them each time, splitting the price of the asset?
