The option for form 5405 is not allowing me to add the payment owed to the IRS; it keeps stating that I do not owe anything. My file was rejected by the IRS.
 At this point, I want my money back, because I will not be using TurboTax. Also, I understand that there has been an issue with the first time home buyer credit form since February, and I think it's unfair that there wasn't a notice posted on your site stating that the e-file option would not be available.
