During 2014 I obtained a tax payer ID #.  So for 2014 I have 4 1099s for my SS# and 3 1099s for my TIN.  Do I prepare 2 Schedule Cs, one for each number?
 Tax assessment does not include "deductions from Federal adjusted gross income", and thus changes my refund to a tax due. What happened? Did they make an error in reviewing my return?
