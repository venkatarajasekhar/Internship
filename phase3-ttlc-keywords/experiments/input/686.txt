1099-B for custodial account
 Our son is 23.  We can still claim him as a dependent on our 2014 taxes.  In 2014 we redeemed shares for a custodial account held by his father for him, to use for tuition for his last year of college.  Does he need to report the gain as his income, or can we claim it on our own 2014 tax return?

If he needs to report it as his own income, can does he need to itemize, or can he report it somewhere on the 1040 EZ?

Thank you!
