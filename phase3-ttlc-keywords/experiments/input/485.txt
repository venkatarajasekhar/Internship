Form 8824 ERROR Message. Please help.
 I am getting this error and I do not understand what to do when I look at the Tax Help Topic.  Please help. "Schedule C (Commission Earnings, Direct Sales) -- Car &amp; Truck Expenses Worksheet (Mitsubishi Galant): Form 8824 link-1 should be blank. You have linked vehicles with different holding periods (i.e.: short-term and long-term) to the same Form 8824. Multiple vehicles can only be linked to the same Form 8824 when they are all components of a single asset. See Form 8824 Tax Help for instructions on entering a transaction involving multiple assets."
