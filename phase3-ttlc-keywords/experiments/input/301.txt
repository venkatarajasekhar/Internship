Is this notice of adjustment to my Maryland income tax return a mistake? Is it possible I claimed a deduction on my federal return but not on my Maryland state return?
 I want to know if this fee is something that I should be paying or if I should dispute.  It says they look up taxpayers who claim a deduction for tuition and fees on their federal return and verify that it was also on the state return.  I did not pay any tuition fees so I don't know why they are trying to charge me.
