How do I amend state tax returns from single to married joint? This is due to recent changes in the law regarding my marriage recognition in Nebraska.
 I am a same-sex married person in the state of Nebraska.  Was married in 2013.  Federal returns were submitted as married-joint for both myself and my spouse, however the state of Nebraska required the state returns to be filed as single for each of us.  Now that the courts have mandated the state recognize our marriage, we are allowed to amend our state returns from Single to Married Joint.  I'm not sure how to do this since we each filed a state return and now we want to amend to married joint.  Do we just amend ONE of the returns and leave the other alone or do we have to amend both state returns?
