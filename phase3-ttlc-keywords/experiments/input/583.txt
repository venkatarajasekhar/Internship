The name search doesn&#39;t seem to work anymore. I get NO results no matter what I enter. Robe, pants, sweat, socks, chair, nothing give results...
 Doing the NJ Tax Review it brings me to the Pensions, annuities and IRAs WKS, Part A line 4a and 4b must not both be entered. 
 Problem is that Line 4a has a valid amount that we were previously taxed and 4b has zero.  
 is this a turbo tax error? or am i doing something wrong tmpetersen@yahoo.com, 908-938-9388
