turbo tax has charge me for the preparation of my 2014 taxes but my taxes has not been filed what should i do?
 Hi, I live in NYC and used to work in CT in 2013. I've worked in NYC for all of 2014 but didn't change my work address to NYC until recently. How do I correct for the days worked outside of CT/ in NYC to avoid overpaying?

Thanks!
