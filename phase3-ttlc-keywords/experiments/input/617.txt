1098-T and 1099-Q: how to reconcile their calendar related differences?
 I was hoping that I would get some advice on this topic. The 1099-Q, which shows 529 distribution details from Vanguard for my daughter who is in her first year of college, include the distributions taken in Dec 2014 for the Spring semester starting Jan 2015.  The payments were needed by the college in Dec 2014 itself o/w they would have been marked as late.  All the withdrawals were for qualified expenses.
Though the 1098-T, from the college, includes only the qualified expenses for the calendar year of 2014 (Fall semester 2014).
How is this mismatch expected to be handled correctly?
Is the 1098-T just meant for guidance?
And I can just go by the 1099-Q numbers since they were all valid qualified expenses, albeit for 2015 calendar year tuition. This is my first daughter and her first year in college. Help is much appreciated!
