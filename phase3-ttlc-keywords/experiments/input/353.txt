questions about Federal Gift Tax Exclusion 2015.
 I have a question about Federal Gift Tax Exclusion in 2015. I know that the annual exclusion for gifts remains at $14,000 for 2015. Â Is it possible for me to transfer $14,000 worth stocks (intangible asset i believe) to a friend(not spouse, non US residence, non US-citizen) in china with tax exclusion? The tax rule just says $14k gift per person per year, but it does not mention about if this situation is valid. That will be great if someone can answer my question. Thank you in advance!
