I tried to import my trades so I purchased Premier Desktop.  Can I merge this with my online account, it did not import W-2 information that was stored on my computer.
 I also need help importing from various accounts.  Does the tax software know which account is my IRA and which is my regular trading account? Can I change my trade account to IRA to avoid hassle and save taxes?   Will I essentially have to reenter most of the data that I had on my online account that I filed with TT for the last years?  Please help make this easier, that's what the software is for, right? Thank you!
