There are no errors to correct. how do I move on?
 I have a capital gain for a sale of an investment, but am unsure if there should be anything entered on the the "Adjust Investment Income" as it relates to AMT.  How am I to know what amounts of adjustments to my investment income should be enterd in these three boxes?
