Can I efile a KY 740-NP nonresident return with TurboTax and attach the K-1 and PTE-WH that are required to be attached to the return?
 How do I get this fixed? My return was initially rejected. I fixed it, then received notification that it is accepted. Still, Turbotax's document, "ELECTRONIC POSTMARK - CERTIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC FILING," does not record a filing date in the appropriate space, and continues to say that IRS has rejected my return. I need this fixed immediately. Can Turbotax fix it?
