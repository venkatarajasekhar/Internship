My refund is over $1000 less than last year and previous years - I am wondering why?
 Hi, I live in NYC and used to work in CT in 2013. I've worked in NYC for all of 2014 but didn't change my work address to NYC until recently. How do I correct for the days worked outside of CT/ in NYC to avoid overpaying?

Thanks!
