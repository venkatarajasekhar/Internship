new updates did not appear in 1040x -
 1. I have already filed my 2014 taxes.
2. I have got my refund on 02/03/2015.
3. I made some mistakes when I filed first. 
4. Newly received 1098-T for Misba for 2 colleges information is updated.
5. 1099-SA is received in the last week of Jan 15 and now updated.
6. Now I am trying to file 1040x. 1040x is generated but it is showing any updates. 1040x is generated with the same information as of old 1040 filing.
