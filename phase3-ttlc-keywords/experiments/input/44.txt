I HAVE FILED OR E FILED BUSINESS TAX RETURNS. TURBO TAX CALCULATES NO TAX DUE FOR FED OR OHIO. BUT OHIO ISSUED A TAX ASSESSMENT. WHAT CAN I DO TO FIGHT THIS ?
 I have a small business with less than $5000 income; my reporting requirements were the same as last year.  The large price increase needs explanation.
