I amended this year&#39;s taxes but am not finding the return of $600 something dollars. I even contacted your customer service to help me.
 My gross income from rental in Arizona is more than $11,000 but I have a net loss.  If total federal depreciation included in Arizona income (line 28 on form 140n) equals Recalculated Arizona depreciation on line 37, Turbo Tax shows I do not owe any tax.  Do I have to manually input Recalculated Arizona depreciation?  Turbo Tax is not calculating it.
