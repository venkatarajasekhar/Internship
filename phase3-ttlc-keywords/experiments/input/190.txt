Why is my Dependent care benefit (box 10) being added to my income?
 The Child and Dependent Care credit is different from a Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA). The credit only allows you to claim $3,000 per dependent with a maximum of $6,000 while the DCRA allows you to set aside up to $5,000 of untaxed income. I tried entering in the provider information the the Child and Dependent Care section but TurboTax keeps adding the amount above $3,000 back into my taxable income which is wrong.
