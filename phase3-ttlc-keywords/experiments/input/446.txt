My REFUND was reduced from $270 down to $20.  IRS says my tax paymt was $14,562.  Turbo Tax said my tax paymt was $14,812 and I was due a refund  $270. How do I check?
 According to the amounts on my W2 forms I paid the $14812 in taxes.  Can you help me figure out what to do to get my other $250.00.  I TRUST Turbo Tax. I DO NOT Trust the IRS!!!   I've already checked with IRS and me nor my wife have any current off sets or past due taxes.
