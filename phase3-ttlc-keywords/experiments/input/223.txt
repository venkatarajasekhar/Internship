Dividends received &quot;translated at spot rate on payment date&quot; on form 5471, Schedule I, line 7, are those supposed to be the gross or net amounts? Thank you !
 To my understanding, everywhere else on the form, like schedule M, line 21, ordinary dividends would be declared as gross amounts, but I am confused on Schedule I because it says in parenthesis "translated at spot rate on payment date". In the foreign country of the LLC issuing these dividends the dividend tax is withheld by the company and is therefore sending me the net dividends - and those net amounts I can thus translate at spot rate.Â 
 I know Turbotax does not support this form, but I would really appreciate any knowledge about filling this out correctly so I can attach to the 1040 I prepare with Turbotax. Thank you !
