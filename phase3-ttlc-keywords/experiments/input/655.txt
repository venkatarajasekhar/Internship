I used Turbo last year but this year my downloads from last year dont show.  Why?
 We have a total of 2 x 1099-Misc tax returns, one for $12,022.12 and the other $4630.  Since we do not meet the $20,300 and we are filing join tax return, would we even then have to file a tax return and just need to keep our 1099-Misc forms for the future in case we are audited?  We have no other income to report, such as any W-2 forms, etc.  We would not be considered a church employee as we are not from a particular organization in the states and serving under a European organization on a Visa where we do not get paid at this time.
