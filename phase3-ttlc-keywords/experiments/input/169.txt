Foreign Tax Credit Carry Forward
 My daughter receives dividends from foreign companies, and she has had foreign taxes withheld.  Because she had capital losses in 2014, she has no federal taxes due. Although I have filled out Form 1116, and have entered the amount of foreign dividends received, should not the foreign taxes paid show up as a carry forward to next year?  The form at the end shows the taxes paid, and the same amount "utilized," but zero amount carried forward. Thanks for any assistance! Gordon, Houston, TX
