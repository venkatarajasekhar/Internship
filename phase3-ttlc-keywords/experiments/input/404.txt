Minimum Creditable Coverage (MCC) in Massachusetts
 Hello,

I am originally from NY, but have lived and worked full time in MA for all of 2014. I am currently covered under my parents' health insurance, however; because my parents live and work in NY (and their insurance is NY based), I am not sure if I meet the standards for the MA Minimum Creditable Coverage. I have never not been covered by their insurance, so do I meet the standards for approved MA MCC for all of 2014? Also, since my parents pay for my health insurance (but nothing else) can I say that no one can claim me as a dependent?
