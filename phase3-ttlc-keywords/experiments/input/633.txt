[Duplicate] How do I print the page &quot;e-filing status&quot;? Do I heard from the IRS?
 I've entered foreign income, but I still get this response when I try to exclude my income: "No Foreign Income Has Been Entered" And on a previous page it registered my foreign amount. How do I get the form to accept my foreign earned income?
