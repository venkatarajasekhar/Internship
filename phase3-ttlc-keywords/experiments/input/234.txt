Why does TurboTax have an old version of my return now instead of the correct version I downloaded yesterday?
 7/6/15 - Finished my return online &amp; downloaded as pdf to eventually print &amp; mail to IRS. 7/7/15 - Downloaded the return with all worksheets.  This return &amp; worksheets ignore all the changes posted in the last few days.  So, downloaded just the return again.  This has the same old version error that the return with worksheets has. Doesn't TurboTax have my correct return from 7/6/15?  That is scary.
