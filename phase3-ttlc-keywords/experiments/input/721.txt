I cannot put an AGI number in or a pin number because I didn&#39;t file for 2013 . I was to use 0, butit did not accept it. Also,he asked me to change the  digits of my SSN?
 On the "Summary of Oklahoma Capital Gains and Losses" page, when I click to edit a particular item, the detail for a different item comes up.  If I enter the info for the item than comes up, it is posted to a different item or disappears. I tried going to Oklahoma Form 561 to enter the data directly onto the form, but when I return to EasyStep, the information is missing or garbled.  I am stuck.
