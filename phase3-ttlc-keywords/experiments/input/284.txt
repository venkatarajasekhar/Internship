what is my claim status?... it&#39;s been weeks now...
 TurboTax Claim... NOT refund.
 State is charging me difference, plus fees &amp; interest for a calculation error.Â  I eMailed all requested State paperwork weeks ago, and wonder how long I must patiently wait for Turbo Tax to acknowledge/resolve this. Thanks!!
