Missed extension filing for citizen residing abroad.
 I am filing 2014 taxes for my mother who lives abroad.  She owes 0 tax and had 0 tax withheld.  I was operating on the idea of October filing being possible but now find out I am past due on filing an extension request.  Somehow I erred in thinking that I needed her signature on the return so decided to wait until she is visiting in the States in the middle of July.  Now I realize I can just e-file without her signature based on last year's return info. I can e-file right away but can't access any extension form through TT.   Again - no tax withheld and none owed.  What is my next step if not just go ahead an e-file.
