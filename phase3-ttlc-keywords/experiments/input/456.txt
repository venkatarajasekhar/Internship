Does TurboTax plan to support Maryland Form 500CR in individual filing programs in 2015 in order to support individual filers claiming Community Investment Tax Credits?
 I am a long time Turbo Tax user but the Maryland Taxpayer Service office is recommending I switch to a competing product if I want to claim the Community Investment Tax Credit since Turbo Tax hasn't historically supported this form.Â  Some of the information in the community suggest complicated workarounds that I am unlikely to pursue given there is another product available that provides direct support for this credit within their base individual tax preparation package.
