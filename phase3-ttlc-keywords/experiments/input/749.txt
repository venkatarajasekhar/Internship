I used your service in early april  to send an amended return.  as of today 12 weeks later!!!  there is NO record of it on irs.gov!  seriously   wth??
 When I attempt to open my tax return the program asks for my user ID and password. The user ID is already filled in as "myname@provider.net". I enter my password but it fails to login because is says either the password or userID is incorrect. I follow the password recovery process. I receive the e-mail at myname@provider.net which says the e-mail is linked to the account "myname". I reset password and everything seems to process ok but the new password is not accepted when I attempt to open my tax return again. If I attempt to login to the inuit website everything works fine if I use just "myname" as the userID and the new password. However if I try to login using "myname@provider.net", the password is rejected. It seems that the intuit website has my userID reordered as "myname" but the encryption of my tax return uses the userID "myname@provider.net". Since I cannot change the userID that is pre-filled into the userID box when I try and open my return I am completely stuck and unable the access my return.
