add 1042-S code 15 to turbo tax
 Hi, I have been in F1 visa for 5 years and I became resident alien this year. I received both W2 and two 1042-S. 
 
 The first 1042-S is with income code 19, and I entered that into turbo tax using the answer from https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2329712-1042-s-for-resident-alien 
 The second 1042-S is with income code 15 and I haven't find a way to add it. I asked H&amp;R block people and they are saying I don't need to report it, but I'm not that comfortable with their answer
  Thanks a lot! Appreciate any suggestions!
