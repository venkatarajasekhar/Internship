rental property in USA live in Peru
 My husband bought me a house in Florida cash. I live in Peru and am planning to rent the house in FL. I'm not a resident or a citizen of the USA. Do I have to report the income for that rental property and if yes what form will I need since I live in Peru. Thank you
