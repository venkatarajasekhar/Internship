I have withdrawn money from my sons 529 College Fund &amp; have entered the 1099-Q as income, &amp; have no offsetting college expenses.
 Why isnt Turbo Tax showing this as income on line 21 of my 1040 and taxing me on it?
 Did I miss checking off a box or something? I've been through it several time, round and round and cant figure this out. Thanks
