tax deferred exchange
 I sold a rental property on 6-7-11 and used the proceeds to buy another rental property via a tax deferred exchange. 

We rented the new property for a year. 

We moved into the new rental house in July of 2012. It is now our primary residence. 

We have been living in the house from july of 2012 to the present date--a period of a little more than 3 years. 

When can we move to another house, selling this house and using the proceeds to buy another, without incurring a major tax hit? 


2012 6 months.
2013 12 months.
2014 12 months.
2015 6 months plus.
So over 3 years.
