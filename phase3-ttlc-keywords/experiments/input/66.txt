How to correct employer reporting non-qualified savings plan distribution of both after-tax contributions and earnings thereon as &quot;earnings&quot;  on w-2?
 I originally included the full amount as "income" so need to amend federal, PA and DE returns to reflect that taxes were paid on the plan contributions the year of receipt (=  year of contribution to the plan) as income, and only the earnings are taxable. It is clear from the W-2s for the contribution years that each year's contributions were taxed as income, and I have received a statement from the employer of the amounts contributed each year.    Thank  you.
