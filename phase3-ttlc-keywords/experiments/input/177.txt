1098-T amount (box 5) exceeds (box 2). The difference was used by the university to pay a required health insurance plan. Can this amount be deducted elsewhere?
 On my 1098-T form the scholarships/grants amount (box 5) exceeds that of the amount billed for tuition (box 2). Looking into my account records it looks like the difference was used by the university to pay for my health insurance plan through them (a required expense). It seems that I am effectively paying income tax on this amount (the health insurance premium deducted by the school). Is this correct (that this is income?) or is there somewhere else that I can deduct the amount?
