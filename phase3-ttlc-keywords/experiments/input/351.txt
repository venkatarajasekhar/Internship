phantom income AHC?
     I got a 1099c debt relief for a short sale in 2015.  My tax return "income" increased due to this.  In 2015 I had California State Obamacare.  Due to my “new” income level IRS wants $6,000 back for insurance premium credit.  My earned income was as I anticipated.  Is there a tax code that distinguishes earned income from phantom income in calculating premium credits?
