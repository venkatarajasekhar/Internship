[MAC] Unable to print completed returns
 I bought my turbo tax at Costco and called yesterday for the download since my Mac don't have CD-Rom Drive.  Customer Support sent me a file and was able login and finished my returns today.  Can you please let me know why I can't print it?  I can see my returns both Federal and State but when I print, it is all blank forms coming out from my printer.
