Worked in different countries in 2014
 Hi,
I have worked in USA from 1st Jan 2014 till 10th July 2014. Later, I started working in Singapore from 14th July. I need more help on how to file the taxes. 
I'm also paying taxes in Singapore and submitted my details to Singapore IRAS to get the tax certificate. Is there anyway who can help so that I can call and explain in detail.
