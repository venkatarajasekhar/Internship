No ECN given by Healthcare Marketplace, but I am exempt and not required to pay penalty?!
 When I file for my taxes, an ECN is prompted if I wasn&amp;#39;t able to receive affordable insurance through the Health Marketplace. I called the Marketplace, because I had never received an ECN from them, only a confirmation I did not have to pay the penalty. After calling them, I was given the answer that the ECNs did not exist at the time. What can I do to prove this while filing my taxes through TurboTax?&amp;quot;
