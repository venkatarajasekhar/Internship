Where is my 2014 tax information? I went to submit it but was told it was already submitted in April. I hand submit the return but they need one form and I don&#39;t have it.
 Last year I had medical expenses, this year none, somehow TurboTax entered medical expenses for me for this year.  All the boxes within the guidance are set to 0, but still shows over $12000 on my summary
