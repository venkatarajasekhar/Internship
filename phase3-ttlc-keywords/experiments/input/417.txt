amended return eft debit
 On my amended return that I printed it says:

Your federal amended tax return shows you owe a balance due of
Due/ | $746.00.
Refund |
| You are paying by direct debit. The elected date of withdrawal is
| April 15, 2015.


BUT on TurboTax instructions it says:
Step 2: Mail your amended return.
	Check the filing instructions for mailing info and payment amount.
	Include your check or money order for the balance due with your amended return.

What gives? Can someone help me get the picture straight? Confused.
