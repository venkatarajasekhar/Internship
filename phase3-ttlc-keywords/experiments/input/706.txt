discrepancy in filings - TurboTax said I&#39;d be getting a refund, The state says I owe money.
 According to the TurboTax filing, we were getting a refund of over $6,000 from the state of Missouri. However, the state says we owe almost $3,000. That's a huge discrepancy. What happened??? is the state correct? Our Federal return went through without a hitch.

Some guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.
