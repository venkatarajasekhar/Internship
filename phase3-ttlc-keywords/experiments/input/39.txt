Is the audit coverage still good if I don&#39;t file through Turbo Tax?
 I paid extra for audit insurance but my return was rejected when I submitted through Turbo. I had to send my tax paperwork into IRS separately, because my identity had been stolen. Is the audit coverage still good, even if I don't submit through Turbo Tax?
