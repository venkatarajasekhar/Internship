How to list totaled work vehicle on taxes???
 Hi there, My husband and I currently have an extension for 2014 taxes. Husband is a self-employed electrician and bought a used work van in 2014. He totaled it a few months later (he only had collision insurance), still in 2014. He sold it for scrap in 2015 at a $2500 loss. How do we list this on our 2014 taxes? Should we list the full cost of the van since it's not depreciating and was wrecked? Thanks for any help!!
