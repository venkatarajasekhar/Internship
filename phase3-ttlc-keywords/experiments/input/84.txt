I stopped renting out a property in 2014 but the passive losses from previous years disappeared on my 2014 8582 form.  How can I get them back into 2014?
 I told Turbo Tax that I stopped renting out the property, and it was completely removed from my 2014 8582 form.  This had no impact in 2014, since I could not use the passive losses; however, I may sell it in future years and will want to recapture those passive losses.  I'm told that I need to file a 1040X and 540X (California).  Can I simply go into Turbo Tax "forms" and manually enter the info?  Will it carry forward to future years as well?
