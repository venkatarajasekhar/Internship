how do i calculate witholding.  IRS says I will overpay by 9000 unless i change my witholding
 My original filing for 2013 showed a refund of over $4,000, I went to amend interest income and it took me back to start of TT and now my refund is over $13,000.00. I am not able to input all of same info, i.e.my income (retirement, IRA), my rental property as before, it is not showing my MISC input, my taxes paid or anything else; TT is out of whack?
