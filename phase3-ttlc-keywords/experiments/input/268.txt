Question about LA tax return
 Hello, i submitted my federal tax return and everything is fine, but state tax LA i have an issue. I only lived 4.5 month in LA where has state tax then moved to TX where there is no state tax. Turbo tax program calculated that i will get back my state tax back. But i received today mail that they did calculation in IRS LA and it turned out that i own big amount. How it is possible? i only filled 540B Part year resident in Louisiana., what i have to do right now? i think they calculated that i lived in Louisiana all this time
