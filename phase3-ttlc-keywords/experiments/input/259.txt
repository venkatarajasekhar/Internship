I have paid for turbo tax for 2014 and I am trying to create a PDF file and it is saying I have to pay for the software again.
 your software will not let me change how I pay IRS and instead, want to charge me more money.  When I tried to efile and pay but it got all confused on the date and would not move forward.  Now I am late filing and very disappointed with your product.  Please Help!
