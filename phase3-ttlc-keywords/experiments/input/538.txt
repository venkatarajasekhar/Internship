can I move up the date of my autopayment for my federal taxes
 I already filed a 1040 for 2014 and it was accepted but my daughter's college needs a verified tax transcript for 2014. The IRS will not process my tax return until the end of April since I owed taxes this year. Is there any way to move up the date of the auto payment set up at my bank so my daughter's financial aid will not be delayed?
