Can Turbotax please put the filing date in the appropriate space to indicate that my return has been accepted?
 How do I get this fixed? My return was initially rejected. I fixed it, then received notification that it is accepted. Still, Turbotax's document, "ELECTRONIC POSTMARK - CERTIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC FILING," does not record a filing date in the appropriate space, and continues to say that IRS has rejected my return. I need this fixed immediately. Can Turbotax fix it?
