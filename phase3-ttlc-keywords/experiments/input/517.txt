repayment of unemployment from previous year
 my husband collected unemployment if 2013. We had to repay some of it back in 2014. I received a 1099-G for 2014 showing $0 compensation for 2014 but also shows the amount we repaid back to gov't.  Do I need to do anything about the repayment as it is more than the $0 he received and apparently you cannot repay more than you received.
