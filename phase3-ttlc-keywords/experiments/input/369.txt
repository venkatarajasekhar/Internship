IRS says an asset I disposed (2014) was not computed  using correct worksheet.  I am confused about what I did wrong
 Chimney on residential rental was declared unsafe to use and was abandoned in place.  2004 low efficiency furnace was disposed,  and new furnace that does not need chimney replaced it. I reported abandonment of old furnace on asset entry worksheet, which created disposition report, which created form 4797 p1.   IRS claims error in not using Schedule D worksheet.   I am confused.what should I have done?
