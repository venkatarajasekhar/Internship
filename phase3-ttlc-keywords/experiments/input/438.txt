How do I know how much bond amortization to deduct from tax exempt income?
 My 1099 shows "Bond Premium-Covered" in Box 11 as 1367.35.  Later details show "Bond Premium-Non-covered" as 52828.99.  And further details later on show "Annual Bond Amortization" as 55083.68.  I don't know which figures to use as a reduction of my reportable tax exempt income.
