Our 2014 business product does not tie schedule C into the 1041 return yet it has been in all previous versions. Why not now?
 I want to know if this fee is something that I should be paying or if I should dispute.  It says they look up taxpayers who claim a deduction for tuition and fees on their federal return and verify that it was also on the state return.  I did not pay any tuition fees so I don't know why they are trying to charge me.
