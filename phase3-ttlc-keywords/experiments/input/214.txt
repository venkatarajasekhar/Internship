Separate shared responsibility statement
 Is the IRS representative correct when stating that the health insurance shared responsibility payment is separate from my "regular taxes"?  A 1-2% penalty was included in my 2014 tax bill when I filed and I assumed that this was this "shared responsibility penalty".  However, I received a separate bill in June 2015 stating that I owed an extra $613 and the letter states that it's for 'You have an unpaid shared responsibility payment for 2014.'
