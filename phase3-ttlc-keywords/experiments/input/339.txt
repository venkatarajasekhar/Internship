why is my tax form blank, my 2012 return, email me at [personal information removed]
 My wife changed employers resulting in no retirement plan coverage for 6 months this year. she will become eligible in Oct. If she starts coverage in Oct, will she be considered covered when we file taxes next year? Can our IRA contributions be deductible if we both have work retirement plans? What is the formula to calculate the deduction phase-out?
