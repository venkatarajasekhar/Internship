Where and how do I enter an &quot;Undetermined-Term Transaction&quot;?
 I have  a 1099-B that I'm not sure how to enter.  It is "Undetermined-Term Tansactions".  It says to report on Form 8949, either Part I with Box B checked or Part II with box E checked.  I don't know how to find Form 8949.  Can you help me?
