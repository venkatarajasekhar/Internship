Is there a software error for generating the amount shown due on Form 1040-V vs the corresponding amount shown due on Form 1040X?
 I had to file an amended return already for Year 2014. The amount   shown due on the resultant Form 1040-V is different than the amount   shown due on the amended return itself. The amended return amount is correct.   What do I do now? Cross out the 1040-V amount and insert the correct   amount? Will the IRS accept annotated paperwork?
