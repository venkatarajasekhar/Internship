Please help me with my additional State download which I paid on 4/15/2015.  What number should I call?
 Two days ago I started with Turbotax. Yesterday I went to add more and there was nothing there. I had to start over. Today I log on in hopes of finishing and it took me to the limited information start from TWO nights ago, not the one I did completely last night.  Where is the one mostly filled out??
