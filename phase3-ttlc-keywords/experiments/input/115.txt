I wish to complain about the 2014 turbo tax, i had an error on my state tax caused by turbo tax. It did not carry me estimated payment form the fed tax payment why?
 I am trying to amend my 2013 tax return using the TurboTax Amend Software for 2013, but when I get to end of the form I am told to Exit, but dont forget to mail my forms.  However, the 1040X is incomplete.  I am confused."
