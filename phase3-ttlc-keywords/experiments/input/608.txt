If you received the 5071C letter from the IRS, and filed your taxes jointly with spouse, did both of you have to verify your identity? My letter didn&#39;t specify...
 The letter is addressed to the both of us, but doesn't say anywhere that we both need to verify. I already verified myself using the online website, but my spouse could not be verified.Â
