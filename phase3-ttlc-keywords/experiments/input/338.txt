Married filing jointly; AGI = $105K. He has a work retirement plan, she will only become eligible for 401K coverage at year end. Will our IRA contribution be deductible?
 My wife changed employers resulting in no retirement plan coverage for 6 months this year. she will become eligible in Oct. If she starts coverage in Oct, will she be considered covered when we file taxes next year? Can our IRA contributions be deductible if we both have work retirement plans? What is the formula to calculate the deduction phase-out?
