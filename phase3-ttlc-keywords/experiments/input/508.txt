i don&#39;t know what is wrong with the paperwork its notn letting me fix it and cant file my federal return until it gets fixed.
 My tax return was rejected.  I fixed the thing that caused the IRS to reject the return.  Now your program will not re-send my return.  I am facing not filing my return on time.
