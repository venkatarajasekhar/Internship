wisconsin 2014 withholding taxes were paid late by partnership (in 7/2015)--how do i recoup as i was never given credit on k-1
 Okay. 
 I am tax partner for Wisconsin limited partnership and moved last year out of state. Unbeknowst to me the partnership then should have  withheld state taxes unless a certain form was filed (PW-2)--it was not. I have since as tax partner paid 2014 withholdings for myself (by deducting it from my own account) and filed appropriate form (PW-2) with only small interest amt and no penalty (phew!).  But now how do I recoup withholdings as I had already filed and paid all 2014 Wi taxes.  I would like to avoid amending (and even here wonder how) and wonder if I can some how credit this amount to 2015 taxes.
