My federal and state returns were rejected. I had to file via paper. How can I get a refund from Turbo Tax?
 If I go to forms in TurboTax there is data on form 8962 and there is an entry (indicating that I must repay a premium tax credit) on my 1040 but that form is not in the list of forms that I can print? 
 All of the data is in the form and it looks like it is filled out properly. Â How do I print this thing so that I can send it to the IRS?
