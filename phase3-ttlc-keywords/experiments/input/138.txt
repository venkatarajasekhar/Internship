Sale of Vacant Land (personal use) &quot;radio button issue&quot; and Form 8949 (long term gain) &quot;box F issue&quot;
 I sold vacant land (no improvements) and reported in Turbo as sale of capital asset (personal use.) I have found two errors in Tubo's software: First error, in completing the sale information, I used special handling option. The radio button for "land" keeps defaulting to "personal item."  I click on "land" and then go back and check. It automatically saves to "personal item(s)" instead of "land." The sale is not for a personal item. I have edited and saved several times, but when I go back in again it will not keep the "land" radio button clicked.  It is vacant "land" for "personal use" (not investment.)  Second error: because this is a long term capital gain, the instructions for Schedule D states "gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for personal use is a capital gain. Report it on Form 8949 with box F checked if the transaction is long term."  Turbo will not allow the Form 8949 box F to be checked - it keeps going back to box E.  I do not have a 1099B or 1099S for this sale.  However, I do have something similar from the closing attorney.  Therefore, I must be allowed to check box F. Please advise on how I can correct these two items, and/or does Turbo plan to correct these issues?
