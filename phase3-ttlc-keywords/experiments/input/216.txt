What is the min/max interest rate for a forigen loan comming from family members.
 I plan to invest in stocks.  I'm going to borrow money from family members who reside overseas (not US citizens). What's the minimum interest rate they could charge me/I could file for? What's the maximum interest rate they could charge me/I could file for?
