How do I report that I wrote my sister a $107,000 check for the sale of our mother&#39;s home. We got it from a transfer on death deed, as tenants in common.
 The last person I talked to from turbo tax said to report it as a gift. But that's not right, because it was already half my sisters when we sold it. The house had been registered with the county in just my name because I was the one actually living in the house when the deed was recorded. The check for the sale of the house was in my name, so I was just paying my sister back for her half.
