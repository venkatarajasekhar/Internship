Is there anything I can do about a state tax assessment
 I had filed my taxes and Massachusetts has sent me a notice of assessment stating I owe over $2000 because my state refund was for over $400 this year.  Is there anything I can do about this or does anyone know why this happened?  All of my wages are taxed in MA already other than my reserve pay which is taxed in CT.
