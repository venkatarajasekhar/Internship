You rejected $25 rebate for buying 2014 Premier retail CD instead of Deluxe used in 2013, claiming upgrade applied during prep of taxes. Not true. I was using Premier.
 You rejected my online request for $25 rebate for having to buy 2014 Premier retail CD instead of Deluxe I've used since 2000 due to your exclusion of forms always included in Deluxe. You claimed that a free upgrade was applied during my use of the product, therefore disqualifying me for the rebate. Not true. I was already using my purchased Premier CD to prepare my taxes and no upgrade was needed. I purchased Premier CD from Sam's Club 1/11/14.
