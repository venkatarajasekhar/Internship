medical expense calculation error
 Turbo Tax appears to be incorrectly calculating my Medical Expenses.  For example, I put in $100 for Prescriptions, $1000 for Professional Fees Paid (doctors), and $9000 for Medical Insurance.  I answered NO to the question about Medical Reimbursements. On the next, Medical Deduction Summary page, the deduction amount is shown as $10,530.  This is clearly $430 to high. Clicking continue brings me back to the 2014 Deductions and Credits page.  There the Deduction is shown as $16,928 ($6828 to high).  This amount also shows up on Schedule A, Line 1. Something is clearly wrong, and it makes me question what other errors there might be that I haven't noticed.  Please help!
