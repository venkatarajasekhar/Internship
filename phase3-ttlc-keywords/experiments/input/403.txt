I don&#39;t have Childcare TIN&#39;s from my child&#39;s after-school providers, but I cannot proceed with e-filing unless I input valid TINs, how can I work around this to e-file?
 I'm having trouble tracing how the amount for "Other Income" is calculated. In the Personal tab, Federal Review, the Federal Tax Summary has a link "detailed tax breakdown". The 2014 Tax Breakdown shows details for Income and Other Income is one of the lines which follow. But the Other Income amount doesn't seem to match up with my figures. I am unable to see were the TurboTax total comes from. How is it calculated? No matter how I add up my numbers (from what I would consider my other income) I cannot figure out where the TurboTax figure comes from.
