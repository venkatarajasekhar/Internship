I am divorced and claiming 1 child this year.  However, my wife has the health coverage on this child for the entire year. How or where am I to enter this in the program?
 We have a marital agreement, so this year I am only claiming one child as a dependent. I'm showing a $484 penalty for the child not having coverage?  Yet the mother has the coverage on him.  Where do I put this information in the program?
