fix rejected IL taxes on my message has fix not shown can&#39;t get back into my taxes
 My wife changed employers resulting in no retirement plan coverage for 6 months this year. she will become eligible in Oct. If she starts coverage in Oct, will she be considered covered when we file taxes next year? Can our IRA contributions be deductible if we both have work retirement plans? What is the formula to calculate the deduction phase-out?
