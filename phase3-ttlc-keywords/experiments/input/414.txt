download problem with an update that locked up the turbo tax program on my computer and I cannot use the program now. What should I do?
 The file cannot be installed because the file cannot be found in Cabinet file "Turbo Tax. cab" This could indicate a network error, an error reading from the CD-Rom or a problem with the package.  This is the message I get on my computer.
