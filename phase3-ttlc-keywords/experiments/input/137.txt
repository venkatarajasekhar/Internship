I see the amended adjustment amount in the left hand column, however, I am unable to view the actual amended state return. It&#39;s showing the forms prior to the amendment.
 I have asked this question and have always received pretty vague and contradicting answers.  My question is pretty simple.  I did not run any payroll thru my part ownership in an LLC.  All cash received by both myself and other partners were shown on the balance sheet as Cash Draws.  On my K-1 it shows a income (line1) of approx. 4.8k (which is my share of the total profits for the year.  It also shows that I personally drew 36k in cash in lieu of payroll.  Each partner got there own fair share and it varied.  I will show the 4.8k as profit on my 1040, but where do I reflect the 36k cash draw and should I then be subject to the SE (FICA) double taxation?  Please be as specific as possible and provide line items on the 1040 and not just IRS publications and rules. thanks so much!!!
