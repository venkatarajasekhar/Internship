California married filing separately: community property questions and confusion on how to fill out properly. Follow up...
 1)Â For all Community Property sections (ex: Community Property - Wages) it sounds like we are supposed to take the "You" column, divide it by two and then replace the "You" column with the half amount and put the exact same amount in the "Partner/Spouse" column and have the total equal what it did before. But apparently we are supposed to leave it and put in the spouse's amount in the spouse column? I don't understand what to put there. For those screens, for my partner column, do I just divide the 'you' column by two? For instance if I have "Google Inc" as my employer at $100,000, do I enter $50,000 in my spouse's column? Or do I take a random employer from her return at put it in there? That doesn't make sense since it doesn't relate to "Google Inc."
 
2) It seems like the above screens are just for documentation purposes, more importantly are the screens before it. For the "Community Property Income Adjustments screen, do people typically put anything here? Or is Turbo Tax knowing that we are Filing Separately in California and calculates the halves. If not, please provide me a detailed step by step on how to fill this out. 
3) Similar question to #2 but for the next screen "Tax Withholding Adjustments". Is this typically filled or does Turbotax already know and we are just making adjustments? If not how do I fill this out?
