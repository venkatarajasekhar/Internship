Form 8453 - how to get it to fill in names &amp; addresses
 Most TurboTax forms automatically fill in all of the names, addresses, SSNs, and other identifying information when they are used.  Form 8453 is NOT doing that for me.  How do I get turboTax to fill that stuff in?  I do not want to override all of those entries.  First, is a big nuisance.  Second, I may have missed something which is why the form is NOT being filled in.  And, I do NOT use the step-by-step entry as it is far too cumbersome and I have been doing TurboTax by forms for many many years.  When I call up a form, and start to use it, TurboTax usually fills in all the needed information, but it is not doing that for 8453!  Thanks.
