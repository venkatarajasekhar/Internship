how to fix a rejected 2012 return. there is no &quot;fix&quot; button to fix the return. I don&#39;t even know what is wrong with it.
 my state is asking for 2012 return. it seems that they both were rejected..ie federal and state. I go to the return and can open the file, but can not seem to find where to correct it or re-file. I not sure what is even wrong with it.
