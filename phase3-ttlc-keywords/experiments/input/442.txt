Our TurboTax state return showed that we owed approximately $2,800. We now believe this was an error and overpaid by approximately $2,400. How do we fix this error?
 I called TurboTax prior to filing our returns for assistance because I felt this was an error.  The woman assisting me assured me that it wasn't an error, and that there were new changes in tax laws which may have accounted for the error. I was told that it was too close to the filing date for her to go through my taxes with me.

For the last 6 years we have filed in two states. We have always owed approximately $700 for one state, and received approximately $400 from the other state. This year TurboTax showed we owed approximately $2,800 and we would get back approximately $2,600. We thought this seemed too high, but we were told by TurboTax this was correct. Now the state that owes us just sent us a letter stating that there was an error and  only paid us $118. So now it can be assumed that amount we paid the other state is incorrect as well. We have no idea how to go about getting this corrected? PLEASE help!!
