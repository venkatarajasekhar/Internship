Are there instances where  I would not be expected to pay self-employment taxes on other income earned?
 I am completing an amended 1040X for theÂ 2013 tax year using the TurboTax Premier Software. I am including nonemployee compensation from a 1099MISC that was not included in the original tax return. The return also include income earned as recorded on my W-2s (the W-2s were included on the original 2013 Tax Return). Upon completion of the amended return, I noticed that the TurboTax software did not calculate a Self-Employment tax. Is there a reason why this occurred? Are there indeed instances I would not be expected to pay self-employment taxes on other income earned?
