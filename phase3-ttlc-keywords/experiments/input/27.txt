My return document does not include my 1040 form.Help!
 I filled everything out and printed my return to mail in. But all it shows is the filing/mailing instructions and a page about my healthcare exemption. Where is the 1040 form? The reason I was told to print is that I had no income from last year so I have no return balance, if that has anything to do with the form missing?
