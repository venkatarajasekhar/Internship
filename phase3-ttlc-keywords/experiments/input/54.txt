IRA Recharacterizations &amp; IRS Forms
 I made contributions to my Roth IRA in 2014 for 2014 tax year.  I had to recharacterize it before I filed my 2014 tax return.  I just did the recharacterization.  eTrade will not be issuing my 1099R and 5498 form until next year since it happened in 2015.  I recharacterize it as a non-deductible traditional IRA since I can still do that based on my income level.  Do I just fill out that contribution on my tax return (non-deductible IRA) and don't worry about it even thought I won't get the two tax forms from eTrade until next yr filing date? I wasn't sure if that would create problems or red flags for the IRS since those forms won't be issued before filing my 2014 return.
