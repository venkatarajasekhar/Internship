My returns were rejected. I logged on and hit Fix Return. Return came up with incorrect fed and state refund amts. Says I have to pay again!
 Returns were rejected because of incorrect PIN. When I log in and click "Fix My Return", federal refund has gone from $480 (like it shows on my timeline) to over $2,000 - and state went from refund of $103 to owing $34! And, it says I'm paying for turbo tax from my refund...I've already paid a ridiculous $90 on my credit card!!! I need this fixed so I can get these stupid taxes filed.
