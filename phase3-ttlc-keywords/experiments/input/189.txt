For 2013, I see that the standard deduction taken was $6,100 but no standard deduction is shown on the 2014 form that I am working on now.  Why?
 My mother recently passes away and left real estate worth approx. 950K in a family trust.  There are 6 siblings listed as trustees.  When we sell the property, will we be taxed on the proceeds?
