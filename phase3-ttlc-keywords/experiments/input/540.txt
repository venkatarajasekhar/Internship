1099-R foreign recipient information changes needed for foreign resident (US citizen).
 Turbotax 1099-R entry allows me to change any 1099-R information, except the Recipient name and address.  Turbotax pulled in this information for a U.S. Federal Government 1099-R form from my 2013 Turbotax filing.  I am a U.S. citizen living in Australia.  When I run "Smart Check", it says that the Recipient ZIP and State are invalid for Electronic Filing.  The 1099-R shown on the screen shows these boxes as blank, and does not indicate that my address is foreign (i.e. foreign country block is blank), but does show the correct foreign street name and house number.  I have entered this information correctly in the "personal info" part of Turbotax.
 1.  Can I get to the "recipient details" part of the 1099-R (within Turbotax) to make changes in accordance with the actual paper form, which is aware of my Australian address. 2.  If not, and I leave these boxes blank, will Turbotax refuse to let me e-file, as the "smart check" window threatens.  I have had no problem e-filing in past years.
 3.  If the answers are question 1 (no), and question (yes), is my only alternative to enter a phony State name and ZIP from the allowable USA possibilities, even though they would not be correct for the rest of the address? Thank you.
