How do I get your site to reflect the real status of my retuerns when there is no option to re-transmit? I need to amend federal and cannot until all say accepted.
 I plan to invest in stocks.  I'm going to borrow money from family members who reside overseas (not US citizens). What's the minimum interest rate they could charge me/I could file for? What's the maximum interest rate they could charge me/I could file for?
