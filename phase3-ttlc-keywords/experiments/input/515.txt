Form 1116, Part 2 Foreign Taxes Paid and Part 3.  The reduction on Line 12 appears to be calculating 100% of the amount entered in Part 2.
 My understanding is that Part 2 should be the Total UnAdjusted amount of Foreign Taxes paid, and then on Line 12 you calculate the Foreign Tax Reduction, based on Form 2555 and percentage of income excluded etc.  However TurboTax is populating Line 12 with the total amount entered into Part 2 - what are the correct entries?
