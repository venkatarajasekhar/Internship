what is link1? below is the message i keep getting.
 Form 2106 (inspecter) -- Vehicle Expenses Worksheet (Ford f250): Form 8824 link-1 should be blank. You have linked vehicles with different holding periods (i.e.: short-term and long-term) to the same Form 8824. Multiple vehicles can only be linked to the same Form 8824 when they are all components of a single asset. See Form 8824 Tax Help for instructions on entering a transaction involving multiple assets.
