Car &amp; truce expenses wrksheet, what does it mean that 100% depreciation 1 must be entered? Thanks
 I have been claiming mileage for my pick up for years, last year I sold it and purchased a Toyota 4 runner.  Concerned I may be entering wrong information.  Don't understand the 100% depreciation, and that 8842: 1 must be entered. (what are they asking for to be entered?)
