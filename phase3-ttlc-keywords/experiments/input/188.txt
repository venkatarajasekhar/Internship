Help!!!  the Federal Gov. says someone has filed on my taxes and I can not file electrically.  I have been so confused I haven&#39;t filed until now.
 My mother recently passes away and left real estate worth approx. 950K in a family trust.  There are 6 siblings listed as trustees.  When we sell the property, will we be taxed on the proceeds?
