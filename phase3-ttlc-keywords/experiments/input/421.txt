I&#39;m a MD resident who works in DC. Turbotax told me I had to file by mail for my DC return as a non-resident. The printout, does not include my dc return. How can I file?
 the printout only includes instructions on how to file. There is no information, or a place to date and sign. I've seen a few things that say I do not have to file in DC as a non-resident, so then how come turbo tax "prepared" one and took my money!!
