Can&#39;t enter 1098 amount. The box won&#39;t allow me to tip it in.
 We received a 1099-S proceeds from real estate transactions. This was for selling the right away to Consumers Energy for them to update the electric using our property. I can not find where to enter this information. Thank you Cindy
