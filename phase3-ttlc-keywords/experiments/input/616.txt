 I was previously using Turbotax home &amp; business cd/download for 2013 and previous years taxes.  I have discontinued my business on last years tax (2013) and require to only use Turbotax Deluxe for this year, 2014.  Wanted to do online.  Need it to download info from my 2013 taxes so it will compare info for me.  Thanks!
