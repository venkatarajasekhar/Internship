Do we have to pay taxes on property sold that was left in a family trust for 6 trustees after passing of mother?
 My mother recently passes away and left real estate worth approx. 950K in a family trust.  There are 6 siblings listed as trustees.  When we sell the property, will we be taxed on the proceeds?
