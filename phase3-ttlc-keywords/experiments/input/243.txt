Why does TurboTax show a much higher refund on my Federal tax return than what I actually received from IRS.
 My daughters Federal return has not arrived. We need to look at her tax's to determine the amount that was due her so we can contact them and find out what has happened to it. We have been unable to find this information on your site.
