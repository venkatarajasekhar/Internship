Is community income adding my husbands yearly income an my yearly income?
      Is community income  adding my husbands yearly income an my yearly income?      First time filing taxes as a married  couple. We are filing married but filing separate. I am a little confused on  the community income. Does it mean I have to add my yearly income plus his  yearly income?Â We both has separate accounts where each of our paychecks  go into.
