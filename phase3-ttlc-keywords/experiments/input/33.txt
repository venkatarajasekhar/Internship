Efile Pin Number.  How do I get enumbers/pin number -- full time college student did not make enough to bother filing refund.
 I've already completed my return but was only prompted to the Deluxe Version rather than the Free one. My taxes are simple and I didn't need the Deluxe but needed to get my taxes out of the way. I ended up spending about $75 on straight forward taxes. Is there any way to be refunded and apply all my information under the Free version?
