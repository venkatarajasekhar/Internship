I received w2s after I filed for 2013. I filed that w2s in 2014. I am being audited and they say I owe money. Is it correct?
 A large portion of the business income has been reported on a 1099-K under my husband's social security number.  We are planning to split this income on separate Schedule C's.  Is that going to trigger a problem since my husband isn't reporting the entire amount that has been reported under his social?  What is the appropriate way to handle this?
