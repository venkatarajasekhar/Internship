Hi, the funds in my irs account are scheduled to be released on Wednesday July 8th. does this mean ill get my refund on that day or will it take longer?
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no holding time through my bank.&amp;amp;nbsp; money is available as soon as the funds are transferred.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
