have a DBA and order equipment and provide install services to police dept&#39;s, I pay taxes on the equipment ordered how do I file so im not double taxed on equipment
 I order equipment and install them into police cars the police agencies are tax exempt but I have to pay tax when I order the equipment but I can't tax the PD how do I file to seperate the equipment from my install services when they only send me one check for both equipment and install services?
