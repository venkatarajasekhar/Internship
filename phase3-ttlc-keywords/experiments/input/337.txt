How do I  calculate the average balance of two mortgages held in succession due to the sale of a house and purchase of a new house in the same year?
 We sold our previous home on October 15th 2014 and purchased our new home on the same day. So, the mortgage associated with the previous home was active from January 1st to October 15th and the mortgage from the new home began October 15th to December 31st. I was unable to locate any information in Publication 936 that speaks to this scenario.
