do I deduct the interest amount during the rental period from my interest paid for mortgage?
 On the rental section, I entered the amount of interest I paid on a mortgage for the part of the year that I rented the house.  Before that I lived in the house for the first half of the year.  However, there is no indication that I need to deduct the previously entered amount when I am entering my mortgage interest amount in the personal deduction section.
