Getting error message on page but errors are not marked.
 I am trying to find my turbo tax file for 2014, I have a PDF saved on my computer, but turbo tax doesn't see to have the info?
I purchased a disc at Costco, like I have every year for the past 10 or 12 years.  I am attempting to try and find out why Turbo tax figured my tax rate at 2,000 less than the state is now requiring that I pay. Was my income calculated incorrectly, were deductions calculated incorrectly or was it just that the tax rate was calculated incorrectly. I can't log and access my file to see if the worksheet gives me a clue.....Help
thx
