We moved in &#39;13 from KS to GA &amp; have a W2 from the Guard out of IN that reflects as KS income/tax. KS is claiming that this is TI to KS. Would a rev W2 and return fix?
 We moved in '13 from KS to GA &amp; have a W2 from the Guard out of IN that reflects as KS income and tax withholding stat was not revised to show our new home state. We did not live or work in KS at all in 2014. KS is claiming that this is Taxable income to KS and has charged income tax on our return. Can we request a revised W2 and file amended returns to correct this?
