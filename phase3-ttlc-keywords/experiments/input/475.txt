I had healthcare and got the penalty
 My wife currently has a home office and files a Schedule C.  I am starting to use a separate office in the same house for a different business. Can TT H&amp;B properly allocate part of our real estate taxes (e.g.) to each business as appropriate (I will enter % of square footage) and carry the remainder to Schedule A?
