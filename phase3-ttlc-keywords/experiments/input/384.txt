Does it matter if my amounts do not match from my orginal taxes I filed for 2013?
 I had already filed my 2013 taxes but wanted to amend it so I can include my son that lived with me. Since I can't find my orginal taxes filed. I got a copy from IRS, except I am having trouble figuring out how to get the dollar amounts and put them in the correct order. I am off by $30. Will it matter to IRS or will they reject it, because some of the information does not match accordingly?  Thank You,   Myrna MUnoz
